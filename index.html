      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
  <p>I am a father of two boys with big dreams and aspirations.
    A motivating factor for me learning to code is to show them that no matter how old you get, it is never too late to learn something new.
  </p>
  <p>Here is a list of things I like to do in my free time:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Hiking with my family</li>
          <li>Going to car shows</li>
          <li>Watching my kids play baseball</li>
          <li>Playing video games with my kids</li>
      </ul>
    <p>We have a 10 year old German Shepherd/Lab mix named Molly. We also have two cats named Fat Cat and Little Cat. We're not really cat people (hence the lack of creative names), but my wife can't say no to an animal in need.</p>
